# Ae-News

Ae-News is an innovative information project that creates a space for clear and convenient tracking of news and current information from around the world. This project seeks to combine multiple functions into one comprehensive overview, allowing you to have all the important news at your fingertips.

## Project features
1. **World News Dashboard:** Ae-News offers a unique dashboard where you can keep track of the latest news and updates from a variety of sources. This dashboard allows you to stay up-to-date with what's happening in the world without having to browse multiple news websites.

2. **Current weather:** In addition to news, Ae-News also provides you with up-to-date information about the weather in your location. You can quickly find out the temperature, weather forecast and other relevant data.

3. **Future AI article recommendations:** In the future, we plan to integrate an AI article recommendation feature into the Ae-News project. This means that based on your preferences and the news you read, the system will be able to suggest other articles that might be of interest to you.

## Launching the project

Currently I don't know when the launch will be but I estimate it for the end of November.
