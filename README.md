## Key Features
- **World News Dashboard:** Ae-News offers a unique dashboard where you can keep track of the latest news and updates from a variety of sources. This dashboard allows you to stay up-to-date with what's happening in the world without having to browse multiple news websites.

- **Current Weather:** In addition to news, Ae-News also provides you with up-to-date information about the weather in your location. You can quickly find out the temperature, weather forecast, and other relevant data.

- **Future AI Article Recommendations:** In the future, we plan to integrate an AI article recommendation feature into the Ae-News project. This means that based on your preferences and the news you read, the system will be able to suggest other articles that might be of interest to you.

## Launching the Project
Currently, I don't know when the launch will be, but I estimate it for the end of December.

**We will be using the API from <a href="https://www.newscatcherapi.com/">Newscatcher</a> (Thanks for contributing)**
